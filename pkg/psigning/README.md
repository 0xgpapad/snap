Plugin Signing
==============
# Security
By default, the Pulse Daemon has plugin signing verification enabled. To disable it or turn it to warning, the flag `--plugin-trust, -t` can be set to 0 or 2 respectively. 

##How it works
![How it works](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/12282848/10112575/19bec0f4-6391-11e5-8f27-7a1a057122fd.png)  
Private/public keys and keyrings are generated by GPG. The plugin is signed with the private key and the public key needs to be added to the user's keyring. The signing is an armored detached signature in the form of a `.asc` file.

The Pulse Daemon uses the Golang OpenPGP library's `CheckArmoredDetachedSignature` function to validate the signature using the keyring, plugin, and signature file before loading the plugin. It checks the issuer key ID, hash, and signature type.
```go
openpgp.CheckArmoredDetachedSignature(keyring, signed, signature)
```

###Usage
```
pulsed 
  --plugin-trust, -t '1'		0-2 (Disabled, Enabled, Warning) [$PULSE_TRUST_LEVEL]
  --keyring-files, -k 			Keyring files for signing verification separated by colons [$PULSE_KEYRING_FILES]
```
One keyring (-t flag is not needed for signing enabled)
```
pulsed -k <keyringFileOrDirectory> 
pulsed -t <trustLevel> -k <keyringFileOrDirectory> 
pulsed -t <trustLevel> -k someDirectory/someFile.gpg
pulsed -t <trustLevel> -k someDirectory/
```
Multiple keyrings
```
pulsed -t <trustLevel> -k <keyringFile1>:<keyringFile2> 
```  
By default, plugin-trust is 1 (enabled), so the flag is only needed for 0 (disabled) and 2 (warning)
You can make an export to avoid needing the `-k` flag: 
```
export PULSE_KEYRING_FILE=<keyringFile>
pulsed -t <trustLevel>
```

Loading a single plugin in pulsectl
```
pulsectl plugin load <pluginFile> -a <pluginFile>.asc
```

##Creating Signing Files and Validating Signature
###Creating a key for plugin signing
The following is leveraged from the [CoreOS RKT Signing and Verification Guide](https://coreos.com/rkt/docs/0.5.4/signing-and-verification-guide.html)


Create a file named `gpg-batch` with the following
```
%echo Generating a default key
Key-Type: RSA 
Key-Length: 2048
Subkey-Type: RSA 
Subkey-Length: 2048
Name-Real: Tiffany Jernigan
Name-Comment: Plugin signing key
Name-Email: tiffany.jernigan@intel.com
Expire-Date: 0
Passphrase: pulse
%pubring pulse.pubring
%secring pulse.secring
%commit
%echo done
```
#####Generate the key using batch mode 
```
> gpg --batch --gen-key gpg-batch
```

#####List the keys 
```
> gpg --no-default-keyring --secret-keyring ./pulse.secring --keyring ./pulse.pubring \
--list-keys
```
```
./pulse.pubring
-----------
pub   2048R/FE9B5E28 2015-11-04
uid                  Tiffany Jernigan (Plugin signing key) <tiffany.jernigan@intel.com>
sub   2048R/0BC6D4D7 2015-11-04
```

Since we know exactly where this key came from let's trust it:  
```
> gpg --no-default-keyring --secret-keyring ./pulse.secring --keyring ./pulse.pubring \
--edit-key FE9B5E28 trust
```
```

Please decide how far you trust this user to correctly verify other users' keys
(by looking at passports, checking fingerprints from different sources, etc.)

  1 = I don't know or won't say
  2 = I do NOT trust
  3 = I trust marginally
  4 = I trust fully
  5 = I trust ultimately
  m = back to the main menu

Your decision? 5
Do you really want to set this key to ultimate trust? (y/N) y

Please note that the shown key validity is not necessarily correct
unless you restart the program.

#####Export the public key
```
> gpg --no-default-keyring --armor \
--secret-keyring ./pulse.secring --keyring ./pulse.pubring \
--export tiffany.jernigan@intel.com > pubkeys.gpg
```

###Signing the plugin/plugin package using generated keyrings
#####Sign file
```
> gpg --no-default-keyring --armor \
--secret-keyring ./pulse.secring --keyring ./pulse.pubring \
--output <pluginFile>.asc \
--detach-sig <pluginFile>
```
#####Verify the image using gpg
```
> gpg --no-default-keyring \
--secret-keyring ./pulse.secring --keyring ./pulse.pubring \
--verify <pluginFile>.asc <pluginFile>
```
```
gpg: Signature made Wed Nov  4 14:24:18 2015 PST using RSA key ID 0BC6D4D7
gpg: Good signature from "Tiffany Jernigan (Plugin signing key) <tiffany.jernigan@intel.com>
```

###Signing file using key in your default keyring
If you already have a key, you can use that. Otherwise you can create a key and directly add to your keyring  
Create a file named `gpg-batch` with the following
```
%echo Generating a default key
Key-Type: RSA 
Key-Length: 2048
Subkey-Type: RSA 
Subkey-Length: 2048
Name-Real: Tiffany Jernigan
Name-Comment: Main signing key
Name-Email: tiffany.jernigan@intel.com
Expire-Date: 0
Passphrase: pulse
%commit
%echo done
```
#####Generate the key using batch mode 
```
> gpg --batch --gen-key gpg-batch
```
```
> gpg --list-keys
```
```
/Users/tjerniga/.gnupg/pubring.gpg
----------------------------------
pub   2048R/43F744A0 2015-08-22
uid                  Tiffany Jernigan (Main signing key) <tiffany.jernigan@intel.com>
sub   2048R/2ED40FB2 2015-08-22
```

#####Sign file
```
> gpg --armor --output <pluginFile>.asc --detach-sig <pluginFile>
```
#####Verify the image using gpg
```
> gpg --verify <pluginFile>.asc <pluginFile>
```

###Keyring
####Adding to your keyring
If you only have one key, you can use the `pulse.pubring` you just made as your `<keyringFile>`. For multiple you can just separate them by a colon. If you want to add future pubkeys.gpg files to an existing keyring you can do  
```
> gpg --no-default-keyring --keyring <keyringFile> --import pubkeys.gpg
``` 
If you just want to add to your gnupg default keyring (e.g. `~/.gnupg/pubring.gpg`) you can just do  
```
> gpg --import pubkeys.gpg
```
####Validating a public key from someone else
From the [GPG Handbook](https://www.gnupg.org/gph/en/manual/x56.html):  
Once a key is imported it should be validated. GnuPG uses a powerful and flexible trust model that does not require you to personally validate each key you import. Some keys may need to be personally validated, however. A key is validated by verifying the key's fingerprint and then signing the key to certify it as a valid key. A key's fingerprint can be quickly viewed with the --fingerprint command-line option, but in order to certify the key you must edit it.

Add --no-default-keyring --keyring <keyringFile> to all commands below if you are editing a specific keyring that isn't your gnupg default one.
```
> gpg --list-keys
```
```
